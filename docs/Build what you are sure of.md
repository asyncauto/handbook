# Build what you are sure of
Keywords: [[philosophies]]

This is related to pre-mature optimisation. Premature optimisation tells you that when you have high business uncertainty, avoid optimising too early.

This begs the question – when is it the right time to optimise? The right time to optimise is when you are very sure that, “what you are building” is useful for the customer.

So what do you do now? Do you wait for more clarity to happen? No… The world is not going to give you the answers if you just sit there and wait for things to happen. What you do at any given point of time, is to build what you are 100% sure off at that moment.

For this, you need to be brutally honest with yourself. It is possible for you to imagine in your mind that some arbitrary customer in the future will want your feature. Cut the imaginary random customer and identify the feature that you know for sure the customer wants. Build only that and release this to the customer.

When you see the customer using this feature, you will get more feadback, just by observing the behevior of the customer. When you see how the customer uses the product, you will start feeling more confident of some other aspect of the feature. When that confidence reaches a critical confidence level, build it.

When you build what you are 100% sure of you are likely to less time with intellectual masturbation.
