# Any guideline can be over applied

Keywords: [[philosophies]]


Any of the guideline can be over applied. What I mean by that is that you can push that advice to its limits. Use your common sense and understand the context of the advice before applying it.

Eg. when we talk about increasing iteration, should the iteration be every week, every day, or every hour? Depends of the kind of work. If you are sketching, maybe new iterations very 1 hour is appropriate. If you are building POCs maybe 1 week is the right iteration. When you are working with production code, depending on the complexity of the code your iteration cycle by many weeks or months.

When you are iterating, you want to give it just enough time to be meaningful.
