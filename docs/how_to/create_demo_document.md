# How to create demo docs

Purpose of the demo doc:  
- Make communication easier and faster.  
    - As much as possible, stick to the document through the demo   
    - In case we open up other pages for discussion, come back to the document and resume from where you left off  
- Keep a record of events and features  



To make an effective doc:    
- Structure the document in a meaningful way. Use list of lists. Most of the docs can fit in this format:
    - Main topic #2  
        - subtopic #1  
        - sub-topic #2  
    - Main topic #2  
        - sub topic #1  
        - sub topic #2  

Example:

![](/files/Pasted image.png)


- Use screenshots whenever relevant  
	- Avoid opening up a new page if screenshots can do the job  
![](/files/Pasted image 1.png)  


- Include links if relevant. This will help us quickly dig into the problem further if needed. Ex:  
![](/files/Pasted image 2.png)
