# All advice sum up to zero
You will notice that at times there are contradicting advice â€“ advice that cancels each other. The trick here is knowing when each advice or guideline applies. Sometimes VC funding is the way to go. Sometimes bootstrapping is the way to go. When listening to an advice, also think about the conditions upon which it applies.

If you spend all your time listening to advice and never executing you will have gained nothing as all advice sums up to zero.
