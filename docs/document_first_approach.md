# Document first approach

There are two ways to solve problems
- people solve problems 
- systems solve problems

People solve problems approach is where a few exceptional people figure out solutions and executes solutions. This appoach works but is significantly dependant on the moods of the people involved. As a business you dont want to be dependant on the moods of people. 

System solves problem approach is where you build a system that solves problem. The system does not require exceptional people. The system makes is possible for regular people to deliver exceptional results. 

Document first approach is an essential element of "Systems solves problems" approach.

##  Key attributes and specification

### Execute from the book, not from memory

The biggest issues with documentation is that it is never up to date. Documentation is an after though. Document first approach is basically saying that every process needs to be executed from the book, not from memory. 

## 3 pillars of "document first approach" for Asyncauto
- [School](https://school.asyncauto.com/)
- [Handbook](https://handbook.asyncauto.com/)
- [Switchless](http://switchless.io/)

These 3 pillars are org level abstractions that helps us build a system that solves process problems.

### Why should school documentation exist? 
Good software developers are hard to come by. It make sense to train developer/PM/testers to our standard. Training people to our standards is a repeating process. The school helps us upskill raw talent to our quality standards in the most effective way. There is an abundance of resources on the internet to learn to code. The idea with this guide is to be a good curator and will specify an rough order to learn things. 

eg:

- what are the terminologies that a beginner should know? 
- link to "What the hell is an event loop"


### Why should switchless exist?
Switchless is our rinse and repeat stack that we use for solving process problems. Design patterns in switchless helps us move fast and focus on the business problem at hand. 

eg:

- whats the pattern to create tables 
- whats the pattern to create menu

### Why should Handbook exist? 
For the people who we work with - be is clients or consultants or employees.. this is reference manual that describes our philosophies and approach towards things. It helps us avoid repeating ourselves while keeping everyone up to high operational standards. 

eg:

- what is doc first approach? Why we do that? 
- recurring boring activity is a sign of something ripe to be automated

## When this does not apply
Document first approach works best when you start noticing that you are repeating yourself. 
When you are doing something for the first time in your life, you dont have to document it. But if you are doing it for a second time definitely document it. 

**Why does it not make sense to document things the first time?** 

When you do something for the first time, you are figuring things out. Lots of things are subjected to change. Writing documents will bog you down, it will make it harder to find the right path. Also you might change your path. 

**Why should you document if you do it for the second time?** 

When you do something for the second time, you are repeating a significant portion. You might think, the process is not stable yet. The reality is - a process is never final. A process will always change. If you wait for the process to be final, you will never write the document. In that case you are not doing document first approach.
