# Asyncauto handbook

This is reference manual for our philosophies and approach to work. To a large extend we are trying to mimic [gitlab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

This is one of the 3 pillars in our `document first` approach. The three pillars are

- Handbook - this 
- [Switchless](http://switchless.io/) - Design patterns for building web applications that solve process problems
- [School](https://school.asyncauto.com/) - Learn to be an effection PM/Developer/Tester
